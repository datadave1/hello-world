Hello worlds,

Testing the waters of coding and entering in at toe level to keep myself from drowning in this new world. 
Looking to manage hundreds of thousands of photographs that I currently own. Manage somehow by using the folder name I have photos in and then create a relational database to call all of those photos that meet the criteria. Simple but if I have photos of Flowers for example, and I want to call up all flowers that are roses it will create a list by name, date and size of photos.
